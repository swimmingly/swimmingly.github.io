### notes toward an individualist form of government

This not an essay, but a collection of notes. They are only semi-organized. But they touch on all main points. They are enough to begin thinking about the form of government very differently.

Until it can be shaped into a proper piece of writing, I must partly count on your subconscious to organize it into coherency. It was more important to post it than wait till I could shape it up. It is a 35-minute read. See also my 8-minute [overview](./overview).

### intro

We have been captured by a mistaken idea about the state. It distorts our thinking and lives. Just knowing it, one can start to relax in a way that didn't seem possible before. 

The essential mistake is that a state is inherently centralized. So people must delegate their power to representatives who meet in central bodies to make decisions binding on everyone. People must live in thrall to this drama. Society gets organized around it.

The state could instead be _distributed_. Delegation of power, representation, central bodies, collective decision-making, and social-scale drama can be abandoned. These notes relate the philosophy and mechanics of an individualist distributed state.

### metaphysics

At the root of ethics likes the metaphysical fact that man is a volitional being. He can do right or wrong. Principles must guide his actions.

This is especially true of his use of physical force against another. It is a great and terrible power. It is where personal error or evil crosses over and affects the lives of others disastrously. 

How force is to be used is the central issue of politics and the most serious issue a society faces. It morally sanctions certain uses of force and condemns others. It controls them through its state.

### immutable

A state consists of the functions of legislation, defense, and adjudication. Each exists in some form in every society, civilized, indigenous, or otherwise. Whatever forms they take, they make up its state. Every society has a state of some kind.

The state is an immutable fact of man's life. It is built into his nature. Like all philosophical matters, it has an axiomatic quality. State power—force organized for political ends—would be needed to abolish a state (as in the anarchist fantasy). It is impossible. Always, there is a state. 

So it is not whether a society has a state, but what kind it has. There are two differences between states:

1. political theory, or what is morally sanctioned and condemned. Individualist ideologies sanction the defensive use of force and condemn its initiatory or offensive use (ie, crime) and are thus just and good. Collectivist ideologies sanction crime and condemn self-defense and are thus unjust and evil.
2. form of government: it can be individualist: distributed, competitive, and street-level. Or it can be collectivist: centralized, monopolist, and exclusive, as we are used to.

America is one of the few societies in history with an individualist ideology. Its problem is that, like virtually all societies, it has a collectivist form of government. This is the contradiction driving everyone mad and distorting and destroying what little individualism remains.

### individualist distributed state

An individualist distributed state:

- is based on individualist principles (the nature, good, and rights of man, expressed in precepts)
- is upheld by all cognizant individuals throughout the population, from about age 4
- completely lacks central bodies holding and using the delegated power of individuals
- is of maximum size in terms of: 
	- number of participants
	- comprehensiveness of laws (through contracts)
	- amount of power held and degree of control exercised—by individuals over their own affairs

Individualism sets the operational context of the society. The rights of man to life, liberty, and property and the maxims of law are common sense again. Little boys and girls understand, apply, and uphold them. Everyone is legally aligned with his self-preserving nature as an organism, so he can stop contorting himself mentally, emotionally, and physically as well.

Distribution is the natural basis of resilience. It eliminates central points of failure by attack, corruption, or manipulation. Everyone is a lawmaker, peacekeeper, and judge. Every property's line is a border. Everyone a criminal sees is a cop. Everyone knows how things work. Everyone is officially responsible. No one imagines that security is someone else's job.

Everyone has maximum power and control over his own affairs. Maximization prevents the power vacuums that evil exploits. Like a beating heart when someone is cut, it generates positive outward pressure that prevents contaminants from entering.

Some people complain that the state is too big, too powerful, too controlling. But, first there is no size, power, or control of a centralized state that is acceptable. Second, the opposite is the case. Compared to a distributed state, the centralized state is always much too small, and nowhere near powerful or controlling enough.

Distribution fixes this. No evil is necessary. We only accept the good. Distribution is the only moral form a state can take.

An individualist party would help bring a distributed state into being. Its strategy is discussed below and summarized at the end.

Individualism opposes collectivism. Which is the false claim of the existence of a collective being, which individuals are merely cells in and owe obedience to. This is the deceptive evil of monstrous individuals who seek to be obeyed.

Individualism opposes altruism, the ethics underlying collectivism. Altruism pretends to seek the good of others. Since man as an organism is self-preserving, being preserved by others is impossible. So altruism---"otherism"---and its propaganda of "helping others" is a lie. It is code for self-sacrifice, the evil and pathological process of self-denial and slow suicide.

Let no one be seduced by collectivist appeals to the "common good" or offers of representation or stewardship. These are lures unto death.

### precepts 

Rather than a constitution, a set of precepts <!--[_precepts_](/other/precepts.md)-->of law is formulated. These are simple statements of eternal facts about man's political nature. They outline natural rights, their moral and metaphysical basis, the basic crimes that violate them, and how a state functions to protect them. They are not legally but naturally binding. They are inescapable. They form the natural basis for binding law. 

They would make up a short, simple statement, say 500 words maximum. One A4 page. A 4 year-old could grasp its basics. A 15 year-old would be a master of it and proficient with both law and self-defense. 

Everyone becomes his own legislator by making contracts based on the precepts, somewhat embodied in and elaborated by the ancient (and much longer) [Maxims of Law](https://famguardian.org/TaxFreedom/LegalRef/MaximsOfLaw.htm). Lawyers help. Defense companies help people protect themselves and their property. Adjudicators help settle disputes. Good actors---always a majority---band together to crush rogues. Insurance companies are ideally incentivized to coordinate those who hire them directly or indirectly through nested contracts.

Individualism is the moral-political philosophy that recognizes the individual as the cognitive and moral agent of a society and thus its political unit. The individual alone possesses reason, the faculty of choice. He is indivisible and uncollectable into another agent or unit. He is original and unrepresentable. He is an end in himself. Securing his freedom is the purpose of politics. Nothing stands above him.

Possessing choice, man is fallible. He can do evil to others. The need for enforceable rules of action is inherent in human society. The rules, or laws, are rooted in politics, a branch of philosophy. Politics is applied through a state. A state is whatever form laws, enforcement, and adjudication take in a society.

Man is an organism. The task of an organism is to live. The process of living is defined by conditional self-preservation. By will, a constant process of choice, an individual meets and provides the conditions by which life preserves itself autonomically.

What serves life is good. The good consists of the conditions of life, the values life requires to subsist. To act in order to live is the good. It is right. Thus it is _a_ right.

Right is a matter of choice. Choice belongs to individuals. Thus only individuals have rights. Rights are an individual's prerogatives of being and action. An individual physically exercises his rights in the space _between_ other people. The closer he gets to them and their belongings, the more of their permission he needs to act justly.

To live, an individual needs freedom to enact his choices regarding himself. Freedom is a social condition in which rights---life, liberty, and property (body, motility, and possessions)---are customarily and legally respected.

Rights can only be violated physically, through the initiation of force: touching or causing something to touch another's body or property without permission. 

Rights are only these three. Violation is called crime. Crime is forbidden. It is stopped by all necessary force.

A right is related to oneself. One exercises it at will, by choice, by right.

These are candidates for precepts. The final set is not assembled yet. That will take someone with a restored psyche or, more probably, a group of such people.

### rights

Life, liberty, and property are rights because they are right. They are right because they enable man to fulfill the essential task of every organism: to live. To live, man, as a mammal, must be, move, and have. These three organic facts embody the three rights. They make up the process of self-preservation. The instinct of self-preservation is the distinguishing characteristic of life and its absolute imperative.

Every life is an end in itself, not the means to any other end. He exists for his own sake. His existence is the justification of his actions. His existence is not justified by any benefit it affords others.

This is the metapolitics of individualism: the real and logical foundation of the concept of rights. It correlates with the Objectivist metaethics Ayn Rand presents in _Atlas Shrugged_ and _The Virtue of Selfishness_.

That said, powerless people who proclaim their rights are intolerable. They especially inflame communists and anarchists, who worship power. These collectivists are desperate and instinctive. They can smell power and tear to pieces anyone without it.

They also follow and ape anyone with it. The greatest power is living power. Naturally occurring within, it is effortless and infinite. It can be weakly imitated mechanically with discipline, propaganda, mobs, money, military, and technology. Either way it can't be faked. It's time to get real.

### biology

And now we get to the root of it all.

Every organism has power---the natural power to live. It is what enables a man to get out of bed, take care of his affairs, and claim his place in the world and defend it. It is the energy and the ability to act, to work, to value. It gives rise to a man's presence and influence.

Living power is a biological phenomenon. It is a form of vitality, which comes from health, from within. When lost, it is recovered by self-healing in profound rest. Profound rest is deep, concentrated, extended, and has perfected conditions. Solitude, silence, fasting, and darkness are the main ones used. See [hygienic dark retreat](/).

Fully restored to his own power, an individual becomes indomitable. His presence puts everyone at ease and melts resistance. It liberates and inspires everyone. His influence dwarfs that arising from power generated mechanically by effort: learning, wealth, technology, propaganda, etc.

Living power eclipses truthforce, Gandhi's disciplined imitation. Truthforce (combined with _swadeshi_, boycott of imports + local manufacturing) was sufficient to cast an empire out of his country without war, which is a miracle. Imagine maximum living power.

Living power is the foundation of freedom. Individuals can recover it alone, then in small groups in regular houses.

Besides understanding and living power, autonomous infrastructure (an update on swadeshi) is the other critical component of freedom and of a strategy for restoring freedom. It is discussed toward the end of these notes.

#### why?

Centralization began among people who were weakened by cataclysmic trauma. Some were weaker than others. Following the stronger ones was a natural and logical makeshift. Also, by submitting to this new hierarchy, the weak could better defend themselves against marauders rendered psychopathic by trauma. 

Once set, the pattern developed. It was effective and it remained necessary: the weakness didn't go away. The resulting division of labor was interesting and convenient. 

Psychopaths within used enemy attacks to justify further centralization. Technology compensated for the weakness. But it weakened people further. Decent people still had no better solution.

### so much for voting and representation

Voting is a nauseating exercise. People like it as much as paying taxes. They only vote because they are desperate. They have no idea what else to do. 

The whole business of elections and referendums is disgusting. _Inaction_ within centralized political systems is the instinct of everyone with a shred of decency (including bureaucrats whose policies and procedures make their agencies function as poorly as possible.) Normal people don't want to be involved. They are relieved to turn it over to the psychopaths and heroes who enjoy it, then be done with it for another four years.

An individualist party would turn abstention into a meaningful choice. It delegitimizes the establishment, imploding it. A distributed state weaponizes decency against the cause of corruption: power delegated en masse to central governmental bodies.

Members of central bodies abuse power, just as the masses deserve. The people have given up the most precious thing they had: their personal, living power to lead their own lives; their say-so over their own existences. So centralized politicians use people for their own purposes. Why would they do otherwise? The people proved themselves unworthy. They mandated slavery by voting, so why not give it to them?

One who delegates his power throws away what he most needs to live. It is a contemptible act, rendering him subhuman. Politicians start treating him accordingly. In the deepest sense, delegation broadcasts a death wish, a command that, by its persistence, obliges politicians to obey.

This is the dark heart of a centralized state. It is a mass suicide ritual in slow motion. Look at officials' clothing: intimidating uniforms, black robes, stiff suits. They are always at a capture, execution, and funeral.

All the natural human qualities democracy condemns as civic sins are the virtues of a free state: apathy, inertia, selfishness, disregard for the "public good" (an altruist-collectivist fantasy).

Data mining and individualized micro-targeting of political ads (see the film, "Brexit: The Uncivil War") are _made_ for individualism and a distributed state. Everyone gripes about state controls somehow. The party rubs that nerve raw. An exodus is coming, a permanent, general strike from central government, just as in the Velvet Revolution in Czech Republic, _Atlas Shrugged_, and in "La Belle Verte" (particularly in the history the heroine's sons share at 1:07:30).

Individualism can win a first challenge. But without proper preparation (several individuals restored to sufficient power) the collectivists' second challenge could recapture people more deeply than before with new levels of brutality and fearsomeness.

### current powers

A more important power of citizens than voting is jury nullification of unjust laws. But it has been suppressed by centralized courts. 

Most important is the prosecution of suits in court. Common people can do this without lawyers. Dr Frederick Graves and his 100k students have proven this with his law course, [Jurisdictionary](https://howtowinincourt.com?refercode=DA0054). It takes only _6-8 hours_ (!) of study.

Of course, the will to self-defense and the skills necessary are important at all times. But this is where liberation by learning and action breaks down. The will to self-defense is a function of power, a biological phenomenon. Without it, any program, no matter how good, is useless. With it, such programs for beating back evil become redundant.

### tragedy

The tragedy of America is that its individualist philosophy got no individualist form of government to match it and express itself through. The Founders gave it a collectivist form of government: the centralized state they assumed a state is. They built a collectivist machine. It produces collectivism whether fed individualist or collectivist ideas. Now its product has nearly overthrown its feedstock.

Centralization means representation, voting, and controversy. This leads to secrecy, corruption, injustice, salvation, and reform. It all makes a pointless drama in which everyone is dragged along in everyone else's demands and sacrifices. It is the primary racket of civilization: traumatize people into powerlessness, then offer them protection. Surrender power, bargain for some of it back.

No. It is my power to begin with. I say what happens with it. I retain it in my cell of the distributed state. This gives me no opening to use it anywhere else, and I don't want any. Those who do will be frustrated and stopped.

An individualist party is just a restorative influence. It calls people back to psycho-political health and supports them in ruling their own lives, as so many of us are desperately trying to do, despite the burgeoning armies of busybodies. 

What can individualists do against, for example, a polluter? Complain privately and offer help to fix it. Then point out the problem publicly. Set a deadline. Boycott. Sue.

Anyone who is not an individualist---a believer in the rights of man---is a criminal sympathizer. As Gandhi said, "Non-cooperation with evil is as much of a duty as cooperation with good."

Respecting others' rights is normal to healthy people. It is common sense and a natural form of government. It is always with us, always available, just obscured sometimes.

### security vs safety

A principal way the centralized state has taken over everything is by conflating security with safety. Security—preparations to stop crime—is the normal purpose of government. Safety—care in avoiding mechanical injury—is everyone's responsibility all the time.

This includes commerce. A seller's reputation is on the line with every transaction. Industrial associations, private testing labs, insurers, and early adopters will see to the fitness for purpose of goods and services ahead of time. Sellers and producers who fail egregiously after the fact can be sued according to centuries-old legal maxims.

The US government took over the responsibility for safety with its alphabet agencies. It pretends to remove risk and danger from life, an impossibility. With the corona hoax, it siezed total power over the minutest movements of everyone on the planet—for their own safety. Many more suffered and died from the controls than the disease (whatever it really was).

Also, by viewing everything directly or indirectly as a matter of national security, the centralized state assumed power over all aspects of life. The legislature extended massive financial support and legal protections to certain industries and companies as part of ensuring this pseudo-security (eg, too-big-to-fail companies, the Invention Secrecy Act).

Many people can't tie their shoes as a result of such coddling. On the other side of the equation, polluters call in favors. Manufacturers use limited liability to get away with murder. Slick operators alternate employment between industries and the agencies that regulate them.

In the distributed state, responsibility for personal safety is in the hands of individuals. Those so inept that they can't survive in the padded, safety-netted sandbox of industrial culture will continue eliminating themselves from the gene pool, as they do everyday in droves anyway. See a list of all causes of death. It's absurd. The dangers inherent in nature do not constitute crimes, so the state has no legitimate concern with them.

### history and workings

Here are the history and workings of a distributed state.

1. Man lived a long time in happiness, harmony, and peace.
2. An ancient cataclysm destroyed nearly everything, including natural human society. Some places got hit worse than others. Most survivors were rendered helpless. The hero and psychopath emerged to protect and control people. Civilization arose to minimize the resulting chaos, to distribute the shock of cataclysm, to maximize the number and quality of people who would try to figure out what the hell happened and what to do about it. Indigenous lifeways arose in less affected areas as less chaotic adaptations. 
3. Millennia of delegating our authority to centralized states have totally debased us. We surrendered what power we had left after the disaster. It was too little to manage our own affairs with. Our responsibility was delegated with it. We became soft. Our representatives have held a legal monopoly on the use of force within our territories. We were punished for defending ourselves.
4. Externalities: more recently, the chief industrial sponsors of the state were excepted from decency. The stench and din of their "unsellable production"—pollution—turned everyone into the filters, silencers, dampeners, and scrubbers they should have installed in their factories. They took over whole areas, made them unlivable, enslaved the occupants by barring them legally from doing anything else, and discarded the bodies used up in their mechanical processes with subsistence welfare programs. The whining apocalyptic nightmare drove people mad, made them sympathetic to collectivist moves to control the poisoning, the externalizing—the irresponsible imposition on neighbors—of uncontrolled and dangerous industrial processes. This is the most widespread form of crime that exists. It affects everyone all the time. It has to stop. Probably only a mass strike will accomplish it (as in _Atlas Shrugged_ by Ayn Rand and "La Belle Verte" a film by Coline Serreau).
5. The whole mess results in individual near-powerlessness. What power an individual had left after the cataclysm was insufficient to manage his life himself. He had to delegate it to central governmental bodies: legislative, executive, and judiciary, often in one person or small group.

    Each of us must recover his full measure of vital power, then manage the use of force ourselves. State functions must be distributed. A critical mass of individuals (5-10) will recover the natural power necessary to influence society toward it (see biology section). Authority in this comes from ability. It cannot be faked or merely claimed.
6. An individualist party defines universal yet non-binding precepts of law and government. Definitions are short and simple enough for children to understand and use. Precepts are based on natural or inherent rights of individuals to life, liberty, property: the body, motility, and possessions, and how they are violated (descriptions of basic crimes). Everyone knows them. No one likes being assaulted, captured, or robbed.
7. In accord with the precepts, everyone legislates for himself with contracts, defends himself with force, and settles his own disputes. He hires counselors, defenders, and adjudicators to assist him as needed. He explicitly retains his authority to rule himself. No one has a legal monopoly on the socially sanctioned use of force. Everyone is accountable at all times for its proper use. Everything in society (streets, sidewalks, parks, water, stores, etc), is only available by contract. Parents sign these for their children until cognizance is demonstrated (about age 4 for some things).
8. Public objection to the precepts identifies objectors as sympathizers with crime. They instantly lose respect and business. Violators of the precepts oppose an entire population that is practiced in upholding them. Violation presents everyone an opportunity to profit by setting the matter straight.
9. Damages are made up for with money, not punishment.
10. Recognition of the rights of everyone, including children; and liberation of all rightful activity, including the slow suicide of decadence and dissipation, restores natural incentives. Crime stops paying. Rather than the state, crime will wither away.

### meta

#### sources

Certain books are essential to fully understanding the individualist distributed state. They hold its philosophy, mechanics, and image---what it would be like.

_Atlas Shrugged_ by Ayn Rand is important to read first. Rand sets the stage for the next two. The image and some mechanics are especially present in part 3, chapters 1-2.

_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ by Robert Heinlein shows a whole world operating in a distributed way. It is super fast-paced and fun, like all his books.

[_The Market for Liberty_](https://mises.org/library/book/market-liberty) by Morris and Linda Tannehill focuses on the mechanics but has plenty of philosophy and examples. They show how every function of centralized states is or would be better handled by individuals and companies. They explain the many failures of centralized states. They show the intriguing role of insurance companies in organizing most state functions: validating and insuring contracts, providing security and arbitration for those they insure, coordinating security forces and weaponry for even large-scale defense. The cost of governance can decrease from its current despotic rapacity to negligible levels with normal levels of profitability of business.

Besides books, normal relations between people show it as well. Every moment we deal with each other peacefully, we are making and keeping our own laws, providing our own security, settling our own disputes. Thus we are maintaining the state: the unchanging condition of society. I mean the requirement of society: peace. _The state is peace._

#### criticism

Robert Heinlein has great flashes of insight and humor. He is not as deep as Rand or the Tannehills. His errors aren't much different than theirs. Mostly, I remember the impressions of lunar freedom, the fun physics, and the logic of events.

The Tannehills' book is a detailed development of Murray Rothbard's ideas into a practical solution. Like him, they only erred in saying that non-centralized commercial provision of state services implies the absence of a government or state. No, it just means the absence of a centralized state. The state still exists, distributed among the entire population. Its chambers are dinner tables and ordinary offices, not capitol buildings, palaces, and courts. In Ayn Rand's terms, let us avoid being anti-conceptual, concrete-bound "missing links" in this matter.

Ayn Rand erred with the Founders and anarchists alike (and nearly everyone throughout civilized history) in assuming a state is necessarily centralized. Its monopoly on the rightful use of force logically follows, and she affirmed it. Distribution renders the issue moot. It obviates the false alternative Rothbard and Rand pose.

But she was right in asserting the political nature of man, his corresponding need for a state, and for lawful control of its use of force. Man possesses the faculty of choice. He can err dangerously or do evil. He needs principles to guide his action. Or he must be stopped by force according to those principles. Whoever does this, in whatever capacity, and under whatever circumstances, defends the state of man. No assembly required.

To deny what a thing is is to deny _that_ it is. Its destruction logically follows. To deny the state is to deny man's political nature and thus to destroy him. To eliminate the state, an ineradicable fact of human society, logically requires politically motivated force, ie, state action. This disarms and demoralizes everyone, attracting totalitarian dictatorship. 

Note that an individual is then still in control, not of himself, but of everyone. The individual is still the prime entity in the society. Autocracy, which logically means self-rule, means something unpleasantly different.

Every collectivist movement has an anarchist vanguard. Every collectivist regime finally comes to power through anarchy: chaotic destruction of the last of the existing state. Which, in our case, was eroded through a generations-long campaign of ideological subversion (see interviews with Yuri Bezmanov). This leads to even more death. 

Good politics improves things from the first moment. It doesn't make them worse.

In truth, people deny the state out of metaphysical suffering. Follow the logic:

Denial of the state comes from denial of man's political nature  
from denial of his social nature,  
from social discomfort,  
from self-hatred,  
from personal discomfort,  
from chronic, insoluble personal powerlessness, failure, and pain, both physical and psychical.

The problem is not the state—the social embodiment of man's political nature. The problem is a _centralized_ state arising from mass-scale unhealed trauma and the resulting desperation, confusion, and personal dysfunction. The solution is the distributed state arising from logic and personal restoration.

This is the way out.

### structure

- Rights
	- Life is conditional. Some things are good for it, others bad. To attain the good is good. For man, the volitional being, to choose to do so is right. Therefore it is a right. It is his right  among others who could choose to physically stop him. To live, a human must:
		- be
		- move
		- get
	- therefore these things are right, therefore these things are rights
	- Rights: meanings {crimes violating them}
		- Life: body
			- {poisoning*, assault, battery, maiming, murder} 
			- {*usually pollution: noise, material (plasma, gas, liquid, solid), light, electromagnetism. Sensible, at least to some, and in those cases, detectable by anyone with instruments.}
		- Liberty: motility
			- {obstruction, capture}
			- {harassment: unwelcome presence from someone when stationary}
		- Property: possessions 
			- originates by "mixing one's efforts" with natural materials
			- {vandalism, fraud, theft}
- Party
	- issues these non-binding precepts as open source project
	- provides forum for networking
	- organizes embassy
	- all activities and projects ad hoc
	- membership by self-identification and natural acceptance by others
- State:
	- Function: to stop crime. Crime is the initiation of physical force by one man against another. It consists of touching another's person or property without his permission, or threatening to, with anything physical that is sensible, harmful, and unavoidable. This is how rights are violated. Self-defense is the use of force against an initiator sufficient to stop him. The state merely fortifies and multiplies the right of self-defense. Criminals reduce social intercourse to gang warfare. The state ensures that the innocent belong to the biggest gang.
	- According to the precepts,
		- individuals 
			- write their own laws with contracts
			- defend themselves with all necessary force 
			- resolve their own disputes
			- hire counselors, defenders, and adjudicators to assist them as needed
		- counselors, defenders, and adjudicators offer and manage their services
		- insurance companies further organize these things to protect those they insure
		- all band together when necessary to thwart large threats, by prior agreement and funding through insurance companies

#### choice

Only individuals have the faculty of choice. Choosing is necessary for life. Therefore it is a right. 

People choose in order to gain the good. Good is what serves the life of the individual concerned. An individual is the final arbiter of his own good. Only he can know all the facts and values involved. Only he can attain them. An error in choosing is politically irrelevant as long as it is within his rights.

We acknowledge our need for freedom from each other so that we can be ourselves and be together. The alternative is isolation and war.

Freedom is the quality of a society that stands against the initiation of force in its laws, defenses, judgments, and attitudes.

#### political types

- individualism
	- pure: band society
	- civilized: capitalism 
	- semi/pseudo: conservatism, anarcho-capitalism, voluntarism, agorism
- collectivism  
	- perfect: anarchy
	- pure: communism
	- near: fascism, monarchy, Islam, Catholicism
	- weak: socialism, democracy, republic, Satanism, tribalism

#### anti-anarchy

The worst attitude is to deny the state as such, ie, anarchy. This naive repression causes the state to assume the worst possible forms. Anarchy is the most insidious form of collectivism. Communists spread the lie of anarchy among conscientious but naive youth. Who become the useful idiots, the paid vanguard and cannon fodder of future collectivist states.

Government is not mind control, but an instrument of control. To resist government is to resist reason, to defy the reality reason comprehends, and ultimately, to seek its annihilation. Which is why anarchists become filled with fear of and hatred for everything. They project their own desperate evil outward as they smash and burn what is left of the decency and order around them. It's a sad waste due to cultural bad training---and the logical result of generations of state schooling.

Anarcho-capitalist philosophy is shallow. It pretends politics can exist without its philosophical roots. It imagine that money will motivate everyone to be good. It retires from conflict and complains when evil triumphs. It is fatally naive. Some people (communists, jihadis, etc) hate money. It is a sign of evil. It incites them. Only force reaches them: either force of presence or force of arms. Take your pick.

#### philosophy 

Individualism is based on the ethics of egoism or selfism, the epistemology of reason, and the metaphysics of realism. Its foremost philosophical advocates are , Aristotle, John Locke, and Ayn Rand. The results are the fabulous freedoms, refinement, and prosperity of Western society for hundreds of years.

Collectivism mystically views society as the moral agent. It views an individual as provisional, or illusory, or as a mere cell in the larger "whole" of society. Thus the individual has no will, no absolute rights. The life, motility, and possessions loosely associated with him belong to the state. 

This is all a lie. There is no collective entity. One cannot live for others. So it is a war on reality and life. It does not uphold a non-existent collective. It just violates the individual to death. It does not help others. It gets people to destroy each other and themselves.

Collectivism is symptom of mass psychosis. It is psychosocial pathology, believable only to the desperately ill.

#### deception

Collectivism, being a lie, advances by denial and stealth. Collectivists lie, then lie about lying. You know you're talking to a communist, for example, when you hear:

- real communism never happened
- communism is a myth
- communists don't exist
- I'm non-political and post-ideological (the current fashion of useful idiots)

The metaphysics of communism consists of denying the reality of existence. So rank and file communists are consistent in these phrases, though not honest. Sold on the morality of self-sacrifice ("helping others"), they are glad to help advance collectivism in secret, by deception. Observe the:

- self-sacrificing ethics and centralizing politics of secret societies
- closed-door sessions of special committees
- black-book projects of the military-industrial complex
- blackmail that participants operate under (Epstein, Diddy, etc)

Individualism, by contrast, wins in the open, by proud assertion of rights, and transparent action. It takes very little to turn back a collectivist tide. It's a matter of courage and boldness, thus vital power. 

### discontinue

Many things now taken for granted as public functions will gradually cease to be administered by the state and be dispersed among individuals and organizations. Some will be discontinued.

- Laws of Enclosure: this system of enslavement will stop. Unused land is unowned land. Anyone can claim it by using it, by "mixing his efforts" with it. This is how John Locke described the process of turning a part of nature into property.
- State-issued money, the great debt-based disaster driving most of the disasters we see.
- Safety regulations: Security is the concern of the state, not safety. Security means providing protection from criminals. Safety means protection from physical harm among non-criminals. This is a critical distinction lost on us for decades.
- Post offices, roads, schools, hospitals, etc: obvious collectivist nonsense. Yes, every enterprise has an aspect of security. It doesn't mean it has to be administered by a centralized state.
- The "positive state" is a contradiction in terms. The state is inherently negative and destructive. It exists to stop evil, not to create good. That is the job of business and normal (voluntary, non-criminal) society. 
- All the pork, handouts, privileges, protections, and exceptions for pressure groups.

### comments

America is not the land of the free. Obviously, freedom here is not given or guaranteed to anyone. It is merely the land of the opportunity for freedom, if one knows how to claim it and to exercise one's rights. Such knowledge is increasingly rare. The system has taken over the raising of children and brainwashes them against self-reliance. But the opportunity still exists for anyone who will curb his complaints enough to take the action necessary to claim his birthright.

The distributed system I describe exists implicitly in America already, especially as long as the constitution stands. Some people are quietly and firmly managing their own affairs. They neutralize state proceedings when such get out of hand with the principle of _conditional acceptance_. "Sure, I'll do that as long as you can show me where, in writing, I agreed to it." Government by consent of the governed is real. Even Edward Bernays, master propagandist, knew this.

Conditional acceptance is taught by TJ Marrs of [youarelaw.org](https://youarelaw.org) and many others now. I started hearing it from my dad, from our indomitable grandelder, Jack Nuckols, and then my late counsel, legal genius, DeWaynn Rogers. Its strains are embedded in the American tradition. You can still hear them if you listen. 

The collectivist catastrophe has now devolved from Babylon, through Rome, to the Vatican, to its Satanic temples and secret societies, to think tanks, to the academy, the arts, journalism, civil service, and anarchist gangs warring on the streets against decent people. It has taken over in disaster zones like San Francisco and Portland and chomps at the bit in many others. But we are not too late to curtail another full cycle of it.

Conservatives may manage to contain the cruder forms of insanity. But they will bring the refined ones as Papal theocracy and a new Inquisition. Poison as food, then poison as antidote.

### strange

Myth, obscured archeology, and scraps of history indicate a strange possibility. Here is the story.

Two alien races living on Mars and Aldebaron (the planet between Mars and Jupiter) fought. The Martians won by destroying Aldebaron, which became the asteroid belt. The explosion ruined Mars and ravaged Earth.

The Martians knew this would happen. They just went to Earth. Terran survivors, traumatized by the event, offered no resistance.

The Martians mated with the women. Their children, semi-callous by nature, became the nobility and assumed control. The Martians seeded spiritual traditions as sophisticated control systems and food sources for themselves (they feed on negative and distorted energy). They departed but kept tabs on their new slave colony through their descendents.

Christ came to ransom mankind from this captivity. The Martian capitol, Rome, the Fourth Beast in Daniel and Revelations, morphed to coopt Christianity with its new Church. Under the Antichrist Pope, at the right hand of Satan, leader of the Martians, it now rules the entire world politically, economically, religiously.

True or not, the horror of this story at least equals and explains the horror of our situation.

### autonomous infrastructure

The need for security does not keep the centralized state in place. Security is too easy to provide. A big show must be constantly made of it to justify the centralized state's provision of it. Parades. Wars. Terrorist alerts. Negligence of crime followed by crackdowns. The occasional false flag operation to remind us why we need them and to push us in the desired direction.

Centralized infrastructure is the real stronghold of the centralized state, a massive and immovable anchor, literally and figuratively. It is extremely hard and expensive to provide. No one goes to all that trouble and lets those who depend on it do anything but support the political structure it depends on. Leviathan's biggest function is to protect, not us, but its ultra-grandiose monuments of engineering, including the market for them. Vinay Gupta explains this in his riveting talk, [Infrastructure for Anarchists](http://vinay.howtolivewiki.com/blog/global/infrastructure_for_anarchists_1155-1155)

Military strategy always includes destroying an enemy's supply chains. Infrastructure is centralized precisely to maintain control over us slaves. It is simply warfare. 

Freedom requires autonomous infrastructure. Autonomous means not just off-grid, but simple, minimal, cheap, durable, maintainable, self-replaceable or attainable without re-enslavement, and self-eliminating if possible. It goes beyond the expensive, complicated solar and wind installations that most suppliers want to sell, for example.

Gupta concretized autonomous infrastructure with the [Hexayurt Project](https://hexayurt.com). He sets the stage for us. See also his story, "The Unpluggers" about people who bail on our high-cost lifestyle.

[Low-tech Magazine](https://lowtechmagazine.com) by Kris de Decker is one of the most fascinating and readable sites on the web. He exposes the impossibility of a high-tech sustainable society based on renewable energy. He unearths old technologies for modern application (and instructiveness). He provides low-tech solutions to go off-grid, even in rented apartments in cities, just as he has to an unusual degree. He's funny, contrarian, and very creative. He has several good interviews (@DoomerOptimism)and presentations on YouTube. These helped me understand Gupta better and see autonomous infrastructure as the missing, third element of an individualist strategy to restore freedom in the world.

[Living Energy Farm](https://livingenergyfarm.org) uses direct solar power—no expensive batteries or controllers—in most of its systems. The (@DoomerOptimism) interview on YouTube is good.

My [designs](/other#design) and the last 5 chapters of my [book](/) demonstrate the same subversive approach to high-tech: using new technology for purposes simpler than intended or to make technology unnecessary altogether; using new methods and materials to renew obsolete technology; and all to provide conditions for life to revive itself.

This combination of old and new to serve life is part of the low-tech approach to design. The other part is reducing demand to match autonomous supply rather than keeping demand high and setting up expensive, tricky renewable supply to match it. One uses 90% less time, money, and energy to get a higher quality of life. The other enslaves us even worse than now.

### strategy

We are trapped in the system by belief, powerlessness, and dependency on its infrastructure. So our strategy to recover freedom is to:

1. study enough [philosophy](#meta) and [law](#current-powers) to see the situation clearly
2. heal from trauma in [hygienic dark retreat](/) to recover the power that freedom requires
3. adopt [autonomous infrastructure](#autonomous-infrastructure)

Conventional soft infrastructure deludes and sickens us. It includes medicine, high-technology, propaganda, school, and jobs. Conventional hard infrastructure induces our physical dependence on the system. It includes shelter, heating, water, food, waste, energy, transportation, money. 

Sane, practical, autonomous replacements exist for all these.

Every part of the strategy proves rational and enjoyable. Which is the way life really is and ought to be all the time. We invite you to turn away from the boring insanity of enslavement, find your true friends, and live.
