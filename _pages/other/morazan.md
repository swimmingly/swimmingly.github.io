born 1971, Idaho, USA
philosopher, hygienist (scientist of health), designer

## intro

I lived in Ciudad Morazan for 5 weeks, from 2025 Dec 8 to 2026 Jan 12. This is my report of my observations and recommendations with a proposal.

### motives

I left America to try out Morazan for a few reasons:

1. Political: Morazan seemed, from various sources, to offer freedom, including an accountable and effective government.
2. Economic: I could stop being homeless in the cold in America with my own apartment for $85/month with a reasonable amount of red tape. I despise artificially scarce, overpriced, complicated things, such as American housing. I would like to work in politics, and maybe I could somehow in Morazan.
3. Cultural: Americans have as much necessity as others to recover from mass major trauma, the cause of suffering. But the levels of American denial, distractedness, and political-economic obstruction seem too great. I was tired of it. Central Americans I had known in Guatemala were more interested in new ideas. Maybe I could be valued for what I wanted to be valued for in Morazan.
4. Health: I myself am unwell and need a chance to heal. This would come if my report proves valuable.

### bio

My parents and elders are thoughtful, earnest, creative people. My upbringing was less a childhood than training in philosophy, health, and design.

At 15, for the first time since early childhood, I felt the joy of being. I wanted to understand it. Over the next 38 years, my training helped me discover the cause of joy—and how to use it to get joy back. 

### Morazan

My first impression of Honduras was of the tragedies of insecurity, poverty, and garbage. Driving through the gate at Morazan brought instant relief from them all. It was calm, orderly, and clean. I was especially pleased that my building was named for John Locke.

After choosing an apartment, I could relax in some ways. But as I observed Morazan, I began to see its flaws. 

My brief trips to town from Morazan had shown me little of Honduras's flaws. They shocked me when I started living with them. I felt angry, for a moment, even enraged. My mere requirement for objective excellence became an impulse to vanquish evil.  

Morazan should not merely be better than the rest of Honduras or even the world. It should be the best possible in terms of function, in all respects. It should inspire (or embarrass) leaders everywhere, even more than Bukele has in El Salvador.

Besides cleanliness, high-functioning civilized habitat requires good design, not expensive materials. Morazan is in desperate need of a comprehensive designer to work out the details of its urban plan. To do this fully requires recovery of biological capacity. Trauma has wrecked us all. We will advance in peace, freedom, and abundance to no significant degree until we begin to heal.

## Problems and solutions

Problems fall into three categories: pollution, design, and politics. Some are internal, directly under Morazan's control. Some are external yet still possible to influence.

I will catalog the problems along with solutions my investigation has revealed. I will explain the single cause of the problems—incapacity—and offer the way nature gives us to reverse it.

### Pollution:

Pollution touches our bodies without permission. It violates the right to life. It is a crime to be outlawed and internalized with a market.

- Garbage
	- Problems:
		- ​Little is visible from a distance. But there are many small pieces on grounds, 1-8cm
		- Dumps are scattered, disorderly, and smelly up close. 
		- Neighbors burn their garbage!
		- It blankets the sides of the road to Morazan
	- Solution:
		- Buy it (from neighbors, too)
		- Require cleanliness & separation; provide bins, chutes, & barrels with lids; eliminate trash bags
		- Schoolchildren can scour lawns for smallest visible pieces
		- Sell recyclables
		- Sell reusables in thrift store or reuse them in construction
		- Compost food waste for fertilizer or convert it to biogas
		- Neutralize most toxins biologically with compost, fungus, microbes, humic acid, etc
		- Incinerate or distill plastic for energy with incinerator, rocket or gasifying stove, or distillery
		- Pay to dispose of super toxins correctly
		- Bury inert remainder under new buildings
	- Light/visual
		- Streetlights shine into residences (point lights downward, install blackout curtains)
		- Blinking lights
		- Cold 6000k color (use 3000K bulbs)
		- White paint (use warm colors)
	- Noise
		- Onsite construction (3D print & indoor prefab)
		- Sewage machines (enclose)
		- Trimmers (flail or riding mower)
		- Music & TV (headphones for workers,   limit for residents: ~60dB inside, ?dB 1m outside door, endorse app to measure it, seal entry doors)
		- Air conditioners (eliminate by design: insulate exterior, convective ventilation, underground + evaporative cooling (water purification, sewage drying?), roof gardens & decks, heat recovery ventilators)
		- Neighbors (double walls with dampening bridges; apartments: seal doors, insulate ceilings)
		- Traffic (put walled parking lots toward gate. Chinese car racks eventually?)
	- Fumes
		- Trucks (new road gate close to warehouses, certified internal Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) or external DPF attached/detached at gate)
		- Pesticides (lawn drainage, biological systems)
		- External factories (test and supply air purifiers, recover personal power to influence factory owners)
	- Sewage
		- I did not investigate this in person. One or more of these systems may be an improvement on biosludge system:
			- Biogas (_Energy from Organic Waste_ by Warren Weisman)
			- Separating, composting toilet, urine→fertilizer
			- Ultra low-flow toilet (1-2 lpf) and twin pit compost system (Sulabh Shauchalaya)
	- Water: 
		- Agua puro tastes strangely bad (test for sabotage, find better companies, maybe provide it (vending machines or taps, point of use filters, potable tap w/ ozonation or Living Machines?)
	- Electromagnetism
		- Wifi (ethernet in all buildings, offer some buildings without it and with one shielded internet room, build with MgO)
		- Back bed wall (remove wiring and outlets)

## Design

Deficiences in design not only cause most pollution, but lack of function and lower enjoyment as well. The same materials arranged in better ways can lead to compelling value. Morazan must be many times better to win.

First, I will list strategic issues in Morazan's design, then specific ones in the houses and apartments.

- Strategy
	- The **absent designer** causes most of the design problems I heard about in meetings and saw first-hand. The roles of designer, engineer, and contractor require very different states of mind. Only history's greatest geniuses could maintain all of them at once. Expecting ordinary men to do it is futile, even cruel. (Find an imaginative local designer to translate your ideas into precise drawings for the engineer. This leaves him unharassed and makes him truly accountable.)
	- **Onsite fabrication** is obsolete. It is ugly, noisy, messy, disruptive, wasteful, disorganized, imprecise, insecure. Imagine buying a car and having two guys build it in your driveway for six months. Manufacturing is taking over construction. Morazan must catch up and lead in this way as well as in political theory and science. (3D printing onsite & prefabrication indoors)
	- **Right angles** are simply deadening and unattractive. (Within existing grid plan, 3D printing can round corners, curve walls, and vary sizes and shapes at negligible cost. Everyone instinctively recognizes the life-supporting quality of curves, be more drawn to and care more for Morazan.) 
	- **Suboptimal materials:** construction constrained to optimal materials will yield superior buildings, experience, economy.
		- Portland cement (including block): short-lived, toxic, unreusable, non-adhesive, mold-supporting, dead and devitalizing from high temperature calcining (use MgO—magnesium oxide, geopolymer, pozzolana hot mix, hydraulic lime, etc. See benefits below*)
		- Steel rebar: corrodes, causes electromagnetic pollution (use mineral reinforcement like basalt)
		- Plastic paint: toxic, short-lived, delicate (use KSi—potassium silicate)
		- White paint supports psychosis (use warm colors)
		- Gravel: dirty, hard to manage and reuse (use pavers)

### *Benefits

- MgO (Magnesium Oxide) board
	- Qualities
		- Strong: structural, impact, screw pull-out strength equal to or greater than plywood
		- Flexible up to 12mm for curved, frameless structures  
		- Lasts for millennia (in Roman concrete, Great Wall of China, Angkorat, possibly Incan monoliths & Egyptian pyramids)  
		- Water-tolerant
			- Unaffected by absorbed water  
			- Highly diffusive (dries quickly)  
			- Transpirable (vapor-permeable)  
			- Moldproof  
		- Fireproof in 1 layer, remains strong afterward  
		- Sound-absorbing  
		- Shields against electromagnetism
		- Highly adhesive to most materials including itself
		- Non-toxic (used in dietary supplements)
	- Board features		
		- Thicknesses: 3-20mm  
		- Easily worked with standard tools (razor knife, circular saw)  
		- Finish: one side is white (bright white with glassy finish), other side is grey and rough
		- Tape in one pass, paint same day  
		- Use potassium silicate paint and primer:  
		    - Single coat of each is enough  
		    - Bonds molecularly with MgO 
		    - 100+ year lifespan  
		    - Waterproof  
		    - Transpirable and highly diffusive  
		- Replaces drywall, plywood, OSB in structure, wall, ceiling, subfloor, sheathing, roof deck, siding, even floor, doors, cabinetry, furniture
	- Manufacturing
		- Magnesite source is 4th most common mineral on Earth  
		- Local, low-tech manufacturing (calcines at 320°C, not 1500° like Portland cement)
		- 60% less embodied energy than Portland cement
		- Used widely in Asia and Europe
		- Customize performance with various co-geopolymers, reactants, reinforcers, & fillers
- Geopolymer
	- Cures chemically, does not dry, preventing cracks and early self-destruction
	- Lasts 10,000 years
	- Reusable
	- Fireproof
	- Waterproof
	- Strong, replaces concrete
	- Low slump for continuous pours and prints
	- Indications of use in Peruvian monoliths and Egyptian pyramids rather than quarried stone 
- Pozzolana
	- ie, Roman concrete 
	- self-healing
	- hardens underwater 
	- secret of hot mix recently confirmed through archeology and in application by new companies
- Hydraulic lime
	- low temperature calcining, so low-tech, low energy, low cost
	- self-healing

### House

- Drainage through courtyard needs perfecting to prevent pooling and mold.
- Ventilation should be convective (vertical) for economy and reliability, and separate from windows for security, control, silence, privacy
 
### Apartment

- Exterior light
	- Too bright (use fewer bulbs or lower wattage)
	- Uncontrollable: turns off mid-flight, reactivates unreliably, bugs can activate them (replace sensors with Swedish manual timers)
- Stairs
	- Spacing: increase between flights/landings, rail and flights/landings
	- Remove midrail post or top section of it 
	- Slope treads for drainage
	- Big grippy shower tile
- Paint: replace white with warm colors
- Windows
	- No sill (make window flush with exterior)
	- Rain splash (add shallow metal awnings)
	- Inconvenient screens (use windows with exterior screens)
- Bathroom
	- Install outlet
	- Towel racks or more solid shower curtain rod
	- Door
		- Reverse hinge to open toward sink
		- ​Move 10-15cm toward toilet
		- Narrower by 5-10cm
	- Toilet
		- Get lower flow model
		- Integrate urinal 
	- Shower
		- No lip
		- Drain in back corner
		- Large grippy tile
- Kitchen 
	- Sink: too small for a plate (30x35cm minimum to hold tub, integrated stainless sink-counter-backsplash with Swedish strainer (custom "Morazan" model?))
	- Pipes are for what?


## Politics

To be free, one must have power. Power is the key to sane politics, ie, to peace, freedom, and abundance. 

But what kind of power? Conventional power is external, mechanical, artificial, weak, complicated, and expensive. Real power is internal, biological, strong, simple, and cheap. It is _virtue_ (not moral but constitutional), which comes from vitality, which comes from health. It is a form of capacity, a measurement of health, of one's structural integrity.

Radical recovery of health should be central to any effort made to address the issues in this report. The issues only exist as a result of incapacity for a life without them. Issues are symptoms, not causes.

Efforts to address pollution and design issues can begin now. But these efforts will require people with recovered capacity and function to execute fully. 

- Internal
	- All rules provided as web pages for easy translation 
	- Mayor should not have to manage and approve so many things. This was bureaucratic and difficult. (More clarity in roles? Biblical re-education to rehabilitate staff from centuries of Catholic suppression? Hygienic dark retreats?)
	- Make a public org chart/directory so everyone knows whom to talk to. Update it as authority devolves.
	- Secure/safe distinction: governance exists for security, not safety. Safety is a design and organizational issue for Morazan and a personal responsibility for residents. This is in the contract, but confused in practice. Keeping them distinct requires training. Or maybe these states of mind are too different to integrate in one organization (ala Ancap/Market for Liberty ). I am not sure.
	- A woman in charge is an emergency measure. Femininity is inherently submissive and following, not dominant and leading. Long term, she will become unhappy, controlling, incompetent, resentful, vengeful toward everyone in general and men in particular for putting her in this impossible position, whether she is aware of it or not. This, of course, is highly controversial after 60 (200?) years of feminist indoctrination, but results and biology bear it out. Men and women are actually different in deep ways.
- External
	- National-scale issues are probably about to be solved for now with new administration. But long term, living power will be necessary to maintain Morazan's status, either through influence or arbitration. Words on paper are nothing without the power (aka, gravitas, charisma, etc) to apply them.
	- Air pollution is a disaster and an emergency. Everyone is made sicker by it, knowingly or not. Only living power can influence the companies that cause it to clean up their emissions in a way good for everyone. Legal action will bring retribution long term.
	- The Morazan model must be fully proved before effort to spread it is made. The many questions and problems at the end of your book can and must be resolved. It is all possible with power—and the high intelligence that accompanies it. 

	 The recovery of power is my specialty. This, not general health, is the purpose of the retreat center I propose. It should be viewed as an R&D lab, a think tank, almost military in nature, not a place for unwitting people to merely improve their health. That can be spun off later. The political emergency must be addressed first.

## Misc

- Allow people to cheaply test units for a few days before signing contract. Make it easy to switch to another unit after signing. 
- Needed (either from Morazan or entrepreneur):
	- Laundromat
	- 24hr workshop / makerspace
	- Library
	- Thrift store
	- Morazan Institute?
		- to develop Morazan model
		- integrated application, like Tesla One or Daniel Suarez's _Daemon_, to enable deep participation and self-service in Morazan. Urbit-based. Focused on power, current issues at Morazan, and questions in _Entrepreneurial Communities_.

## Proposal

I offer to consult for Morazan to help improve and develop it. While prioritizing hygienic dark retreats to recover living power, the key to success in all points of this report, I would also help with pollution and design issues.

As a consultant, I would:

1. Choose someone to help me find and arrange a place for retreats to realize the promise of Morazan.
2. Provide resources for the applying the above recommendations: information, products, consultants. Some I know, the rest I know where to begin and would research further.
3. Work with existing team members to help them understand and integrate recommendations with their current systems. To a limited extent, I would suggest designs for missing components and processes.

In any case, I am very glad for the time I had at Morazan, and to get to talk to you, Massimo. It is intensely interesting. Politics, now my focus as a philosopher, has multiple cutting edges. The entrecomm is certainly one of them. It is either a final form as you suspect, or the best way to begin toward a distributed form. Either way, it deserves more attention and development.

Best regards,
Andrew
