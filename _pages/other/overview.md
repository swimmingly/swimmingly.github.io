### captured

To live fully, we need freedom. But we are captured by an old mistake about government, most clearly here in America. This essay opens the cage.

We will identify the natural basis for politics and examine the contradiction plaguing America's. Then we will discuss a logical solution and how to apply it.

### politics

Philosophy describes the fundamental facts of reality: its nature, how it is known, and what should be done in it. Standing at the base of knowledge, philosophy is the most important science.

One fact of life is so important, a whole branch of philosophy is needed to handle it: man's great and terrible power to use physical force against others. _Politics_ determines, by moral sanction, how force is to be used in society.

If used in defense, force frees people to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony. If in offense, it deceives, robs, enslaves, and murders people and destroys the world. The first achieves universal justice, the second, universal crime.

In effect, politics asks everyone a single question: freedom or slavery? Shall I live by right to life, liberty, and propertyâ€”my body, movements, and possessions? Or shall I exist by permission, under legal compulsion, to be dispossessed, enslaved, and killed at the will of others?

### analysis

The politics of _individualism_ answers, "Freedom", of _collectivism_, "Slavery". Individualism is realistic, rational, egoist (self-preserving), liberating, and beautiful. Collectivism is idealistic (fantastical, nihilistic), mystical (irrational), altruist (self-sacrificing, suicidal), tyrannical, and ugly. Individualist society is characterized by self-regulation; collectivist society, by centralized control. (Rand)

A society controls (governs) the use of force within it through its state. A state consists of the institutions of legislation, defense, and adjudication, _whatever forms they take_.

Here is America's problem. We have an individualist politics and way of life. But we have a collectivist form of government: the centralized state at federal, state, and local levels. This collectivist contradiction causes our political and social strife.

In a centralized state, each individual delegates his power to representatives by voting or submission. Delegates meet in central bodies to make decisions collectively for everyone. This mixing of political and legal fate contradicts the individualist principles of independence, self-determination, and self-government by exercise of non-negotiable rights.

Decisions are applied according to level of power. One who delegates his power sacrifices what he most needs to live. It is a contemptible act, rendering him subhuman and minimally powerful. It implies a death wish. Its persistence eventually obliges politicians to take it as a command.

A centralized state poisons any individualist ideas it handles with collectivism. The poison accumulates, ultimately killing the individualist core of the way of life.

Small and set apart, a centralized state is a single point of attack on an entire population. Psychopathic and increasingly bold collectivists take advantage of it. The centralized design causes corruption, conspiracy, tyranny.

How did it happen? The Founders made the old mistake of assuming a state must be centralized. Now we are captured by it. We must begin to conceive that there could be another kind of state.

### solution

To solve this problem, we need:

1. an individualist form of government
2. a refined politics
3. a strategy to apply it

#### form

Now we can identify another kind of state. It just takes a little logic. Just as the collectivist form of government is a centralized state, the individualist form of government is a _distributed state_. 

In a distributed state, everyone keeps his power, delegating none of it. He makes his own laws in the form of contracts, defends himself, and settles his own disputes. He hires and fires legal counsel, guards, and arbiters to help him as needed. Insurance companies combine these services with coverage and help coordinate large-scale defense. (Rothbard)

Law in contracts is based on _precepts_: statements of laws of man's social nature. They regard individual rights to life, liberty, and property; the crimes of that violate them; and the means of protecting them. They are simple and fit on one page. A four year-old can understand them. Traditional [Maxims of Law](https://famguardian.org/TaxFreedom/LegalRef/MaximsOfLaw.htm) elaborate them. 

Once, we called them common sense.

In a distributed state, everyone that a criminal sees is a legal expert, soldier, and judge. Every property line is a guarded border. Every building is a castle. Every worked-upon thing is owned and requires someone's permission to touch it. What no one has "mixed his efforts" (Locke) with is unowned and available for possession, especially land.

Most penalties for crime are monetary, paid to injured parties and adjudicators. Dangerous criminals are confined non-punitively. They work to cover their costs and have opportunities to rehabilitate and retrain. (Rothbard)

A state is called a state because it is _static_. It is the unchanging foundation, the constant condition of society. Which is peace. The state of society is peace. People cannot associate and make war on each other at the same time. So the state keeps the peace. It ends disturbances of the peace.

#### refinement

Traditional Anglo-American politics is already quite good. But it does need better recognition of two rights and two corollary crimes.

The most common crime people suffer from is pollution. Day and night, pollution touches the bodies of everyone without permission. It violates the right to life like assault, maiming, and murder. It includes noise, vibration, light, and electromagnetism in addition to noxious fumes, liquids, and solids. Pollution is not primarily an affront to the environment, but people. It slowly crushes some and drives others mad, to the point of revolt.

The second most common crime is harassment. Harassment is another's unwelcome contact or presence when one is in place. It violates the right to liberty, just as obstruction and capture do when one is in motion. Thugs exploit the loophole of harassment and terrorize entire populations. Normal people become sympathetic to revolutionaries.

#### strategy

Natural government is always with us. It is obvious when we are well, obscure when ill and dependent, as we have been for millennia. Fortunately, individualist distributed state can be derived by logic. It formalizes natural government, _evoking it_.

We recover natural government with a three-point, assymetric strategy:

1. learn enough philosophy, law, and self-defence to function.
2. recover personal power through healing from trauma through profound rest in [hygienic dark retreat](/).
3. recover material independence through [autonomous infrastructure][./individualism#autonomous-infrastructure): off-grid, low-tech life support.

An Individualist Party helps organize these activities for members so they may better lead their own lives. It does not run candidates for centralized leadership, court supporters, or even raise funds. Assymmetry means focusing on less controlled factors of the centralized system, not its well-protected ones.

The strategy's first point is familiar. The second and third need explanation.

##### living power

Freedom requires power. There are two kinds.

One is the genuine, internal power: the power to live. It is a form of vitality arising from health. Living power is deep, strong, and palpable. Everyone is short of it. Anyone with it is irresistible, to admirers and the envious alike. 

The other kind is simulated, external power arising mechanically from will: discipline, popularity, propaganda, money, technology, and military. Mechanical power is widely available but comparatively weak. It must be concentrated in few hands to work. So it imbalances society and inspires awe or fear.

We lost most of our living power with our health millennia ago when a global catastrophe caused mass-scale trauma. The natural means of healing from trauma is now known: deep, concentrated, extended rest in perfect darkness. Regaining living power, we will regain real, political, lawful freedom.

Exceeding intelligence and joy in living, also lost with trauma, return along with power.

##### autonomous infrastructure

Freedom requires material independence. But we have physically depended on state-controlled centralized infrastructure. Infrastructure consists of basic life support systems: water (supply and runoff), waste, electricity, heating, transportation. Infrastructure, not defense, is the biggest, most pervasive activity of the centralized state, the cause of its persistence, and its life-and-death power over us.

So we will use our restored intelligence and power to replace centralized infrastructure with autonomous infrastructure. It is onsite, simple, repairable, replaceable without political compromise. New abilities, knowledge, and skills will reinforce independence. Likewise, we will replace the system's secondary services: money, education, medicine, etc.

Society remains stable. The centralized state shrinks gradually as fewer people depend on it. Disclosure of its secrets will occur as people demonstrate capacity for truth.

### attitude

Our attitude is equitable, not vengeful.

We exercise care to ensure stability as things change. Others will naturally support what is better and more enjoyable. The mechanically powerful will reliniquish control when they see things remain under control.

The system is fragile. It depends on complete control. Its commanding grip loosens with even a slight alteration of conditions.

Most elites support centralized control for lack of an alternative. As decent ones switch to our alternative, others will lose their will and power to stop us. We offer everyone peace and a way to heal from the cause of the suffering that drives us toward needless disaster.

### conclusion

This is an individualist analysis, solution, and strategy to solve our problem. One can start small, alone or with others. It is cheap, rational, and quick. Properly understood and applied, it solves or enables solutions to all mass-scale problems going back over 10,000 years. It restores peace in the world and man's place in it.
