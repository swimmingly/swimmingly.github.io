### captured

To live fully, we need freedom. But a universal mistake about government has captured us. This essay opens the cage.

### politics

Philosophy describes the nature of reality, how it is known, and what should be done. Standing at the base of knowledge, philosophy is the most important science.

One fact of life is so important that it has its own branch of philosophy: man's great and terrible power to use physical force against others. _Politics_ determines, by moral sanction, how a society uses force, either for defense or offense.

If a society uses force in defense, it frees people to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony. If in offense, it deceives, robs, enslaves, and murders people and destroys the world. The first achieves universal justice, the second, universal crime.

In effect, politics asks everyone a single question: freedom or slavery? Shall I live by my right to life, liberty, and property—my body, movements, and possessions? Or shall I exist by permission, under legal compulsion, to be dispossessed, enslaved, and killed at the will of others?

### analysis

As moral-political systems, _individualism_ answers, "Freedom", _collectivism_, "Slavery". Individualism is realistic, rational, egoist (self-preserving), liberating, and beautiful. Collectivism is idealistic (fantastical), mystical (irrational), altruist (self-sacrificing, suicidal), tyrannical, and ugly. Individualist society is characterized by self-regulation; collectivist society, by centralized, top-down control.

Now, a society controls the use of force through its _state_. This is where America's problem lies. We have an individualist politics and way of life. But we have a collectivist form of government: the centralized state at federal, state, and local levels. The collectivist part of this contradiction causes our political and social strife. It must be exposed and replaced.

In a centralized state, people delegate power to representatives by voting or submission. Representatives meet in central bodies to make decisions collectively for everyone, according to his level of power. This mixing of political and legal fate contradicts the individualist principle: independence, self-determination, and self-government by exercise of non-debatable rights.

A centralized state colors any individualist ideas it handles with collectivism. The collectivism accumulates, ultimately overrunning the individualist core of the way of life.

The centralized state is small and set apart. It is a single point of attack on the entire population. Psychopathic and increasingly bold collectivists take advantage of it. Such a design guarantees corruption, conspiracy, and tyranny.

### solution

To solve this problem, we need:

1. a refined politics
2. an individualist form of government to match it
3. a strategy to attain it

#### refinement

Our politics needs better recognition of two crimes.

The most common crime people suffer from is pollution. Day and night, pollution touches the bodies of everyone without permission. It violates the right to life like assault, maiming, and murder. It includes noise, vibration, light, and electromagnetism in addition to noxious fumes, liquids, and solids. Pollution is not primarily an affront to the environment, but people. It slowly crushes some, driving others mad, to the point of revolt.

The second most common crime is harassment. Harassment is another's unwelcome contact or presence when one is in place. It violates the right to liberty, just as obstruction and capture do when one is in motion. Thugs exploit the loophole of harassment and terrorize entire populations. Regular people become sympathetic to revolutionaries.

#### form

Just as the collectivist form of government is a centralized state, the individualist form of government is a _distributed state_.

In a distributed state, everyone keeps his power, delegating none of it. He makes his own laws in the form of contracts, defends himself, and settles his own disputes. He hires and fires legal counsel, guards, and arbiters to help him as needed. Insurance companies can combine these services with coverage and help coordinate large-scale defense.

In a distributed state, everyone that a criminal sees is a legal expert, soldier, and judge. Every property line is a guarded border. Every building is a palace.

Most penalties for crime are monetary, paid to injured parties and court personnel. Dangerous criminals are confined non-punitively. They work to cover costs and have opportunities to rehabilitate and retrain.

A state is called a state because it is _static_, the unchanging foundation of society, its constant condition. Which is peace. The state of society is peace. People cannot associate and be at war at the same time. So the state keeps the peace. It ends disturbances of the peace.

In a distributed state, law in contracts is based on _precepts_: statements of laws of nature. Precepts regard individual rights to life, liberty, and property; the crimes that violate them; and the means of protecting them. They are simple and fit on one page. A four year-old can understand them. Traditional Maxims of Law are useful in elaborating them.

#### strategy

Natural government always exists among people. It is obvious when we are well, obscure when ill and dependent, as we have been for millennia. An individualist distributed state is arrived at by logic. It formalizes natural government, _evoking it_.

We recover natural government with a three-point, assymetric strategy:

1. gain knowledge through study of philosophy, history, law, self-defence, hygiene (science of health), psychology, and technology—enough to function with them
2. recover personal power through healing from trauma in hygienic dark retreat.
3. recover material independence through autonomous infrastructure: off-grid, low-tech life support.

The individualist party helps organize these activities for members. Note the lack of running candidates for elected office, courting supporters, even fundraising. Assymmetry means focusing on exposed factors in society's Roman control system, not its well-protected conventions.

### explanation

Study is familiar. The second and third points need explanation.

#### living power

Freedom requires power. Either one has genuine power within—the power to live arising from vitality; or one has simulated, external power arising mechanically from discipline, propaganda, popularity, money, technology, and military. Living power is tangible and palpable. Everyone is short of it. Anyone with it is irresistible. Mechanical power simulates it weakly, imbalancing people and inspiring awe or fear.

We lost most of our power millennia ago due to mass-scale trauma from a global catastrophe. The [natural means](/) of recovering it is now known. Living power is the basis on which we will regain real, political, legal freedom.

High-intelligence and joy in living, also lost with trauma, return along with power.

#### autonomous infrastructure

Freedom requires material independence. We are enslaved both physically and psychically.

We physically depend on state-controlled centralized infrastructure. Infrastructure consists of basic life support systems: water (supply and runoff), waste, electricity, heating, transportation. Infrastructure, not defense, is the biggest, most pervasive activity of the centralized state, its main reason for being, and its life-and-death power over us.

We psychically depend on electronic technology. It is the new universal drug, like coffee.

We use our restored intelligence and power to replace centralized infrastructure with ever-simpler and more enjoyable technological systems and lifestyles. New abilities, knowledge, and skills will reinforce independence. Likewise, we turn away from the system's secondary services: money, education, medicine, etc.

Society remains stable while the centralized state shrinks gradually as fewer people depend on it.

Disclosure of state secrets will occur as people demonstrate capacity for truth.

### attitude

Our attitude is equitable, not vengeful.

We exercise care to ensure stability as things change. Others will naturally support what is better and more enjoyable. The powerful will reliniquish control when they see things remain under control.

The system is fragile. It depends on complete control. Its commanding grip loosens with even a slight alteration of conditions.

Most elites support centralized control for lack of an alternative. As decent elites switch to our alternative, others will lose their will and artificial power to stop us. We offer everyone peace and a way to heal from the psychosis that drives us toward needless disaster.

### conclusion

This is an individualist analysis, solution, and strategy to solve our problem. One can start small, alone or with others. It is cheap, rational, and quick. Properly understood and applied, it solves all mass-scale problems, restoring peace in the world and man's place in it.
