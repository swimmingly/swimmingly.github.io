Hi, Michael,

It's great to be back. I am so glad to find you all here still. And your posts are as energetic and conscientious as before.

I am also gratified to see you kept my essay pinned in Chewing in Ideas. You guys really helped me out with that! (It even got dissed by Barbara Branden. Haha.) I've edited it only slightly since then on my site.

Right after that, in 2008, I found my calling. It ended a 21-year search. I found the way nature gives us to heal from trauma, the cause of our suffering and problems: extended rest in total physical darkness. It is simple, quick, cheap, pleasant, and rational. It led to 11 years of developing the idea abroad in Guatemala and Europe, and to writing a book (see homepage of site linked below). Now I am in the application phase. It is not my forte, so it goes slowly.

Then last week, I realized it is just another piece of my puzzle. Which is politics. I found the mistaken universal assumption that holds us in thrall to our intensifying social dilemma. And I found an alternative that could rapidly set us free.

It is the subject of my new article. I would like to post it here. It is as sideways as the last one. But I'm wondering if you would read it first and advise me whether to and where. Maybe in Politics or Chewing on Ideas again or somewhere else? I hope it doesn't need as much work as the last one, but if so, I would really appreciate it. I want it to be clear. If you would, it is at:

1800 words / 9-minute read (45% longer than the last one)

I have a couple technical items for you.

1. I can't enlarge the tiny text of this site on Android Chrome. It will hinder my participation as my eyes ain't what they used to be.Adjusting font size in my browser and the accessibility settings of my phone affect other sites but not this one. So I think there must be something in your code that prevents it or doesn't accommodate responsive CSS. 

2. From my phone, it took a while to find a workaround to get to my profile and account here. The profile link at the top of the desktop site disappears on mobile, apparently.

So far, so good with everything else. No problem with password recovery after many years absence, for example. Glad you found the bug in the contact form.

Thank you for keeping the home fires burning.

Cheers,
Andrew
