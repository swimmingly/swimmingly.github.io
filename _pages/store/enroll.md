Current offer:

I would exchange retreats with someone who believes in the hygienic approach and has a suitable place to make a darkroom:

- fully functional house
- reasonably quiet location (countryside, suburb, away from fast streets, factories, motors)
- supporter's quarters must be two insulated walls or floors away from darkroom or in a separate heatable building next door with electricity or within reach of an extension cord
- only retreater and supporter in house during retreats or close, quiet, sympathetic people (like mate or kids)

I would come to your place, build a darkroom, and support a retreat for you (5, maybe 9 days). You would support a 9-day retreat for me. I would show you how.

You would pay for materials (usually less than $100), private accommodation, and cover my travel fare there (and back if abroad). 

[Write me](/store#contact) if interested. Please describe your interest and your place.


<!--
Enroll below for a hygienic dark retreat with me as supporter.

Retreat at my place in the USA or at yours, anywhere the USA has good relations.

A retreat lasts 11 days. It is a [9-day Czech](/format#czech) retreat + [2 buffer](/format#extra) days. I offer one retreat per month. Choose a month now and dates within it later.

### price

my place: $4000

your place: $5000 + expenses (round-trip travel, transportation there, separate accommodation in future darkroom*, materials). Darkroom construction takes 1-2 weeks. Fully functional house required.

*this means I am the only one in the building or apartment while living and building there.

### process

The process is more involved than usual. It lets us get to know each other and begin working together. It shows each of us the other's reliability and ability to follow instructions. Sympathy and trust develop. All this is critical to a successful retreat with me.
