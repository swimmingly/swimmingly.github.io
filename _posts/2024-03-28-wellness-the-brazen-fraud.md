Wellness is a fraud for a few reasons.

1. Wellness is an awkward neologism for health. It is a strange combinations of sounds. It is evading the science of health, hygiene, in order to avoid the ire of medicine, the murderous science of curing disease (another fraudulent idea)  that teaches us how to maintain and recover health: hygiene.

A word indicates the truthfulness of the idea it stands for. Wellness is a clumsy lie.

2. Health can't be produced for people. Organisms produce their own health. Organisms are self-preserving. The power to live is with organisms, not products. 

Get it through, big business. ___I___ live my life. You don't do it for me.

All you can sell are conditions. Some of what some of you sell qualifies as a normal condition of life. Your customers are healthier for your products. That doesn't mean you produced their wellness. It just means you produced a _good_. Good. Keep doing that. But change your presumptuous marketing.

the latest in a long line of big frauds invented and by the sick minds in our phony society.
