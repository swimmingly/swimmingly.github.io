Somewhere Jean Liedloff mentioned her Little Rules that she gave parents. I wondered what they were for years, guessing a few from her book. Finally, I asked the Continuum Network about them. Jean's literary trustee, Scott Noelle, was kind enough to furnish them along with his comments on them.

Hi Andrew,

I have some background info I can share...

Jean Liedloff did compile a set of "rules" based on her many, many
consultations with modern Continuum Concept parents in the 1980s, '90s, and early '00s.
She included the rules in some of the notes she wrote to prepare for a
Continuum Concept follow-up book, which never made it past her legendary
writer's block (aka "the Beast"). Since I have Jean's actual notes, I'm
happy to share what I believe to be the final list of the rules. (I think
there were other versions of the list floating around back in the '90s, so
there may be other rules not included here.)

So here are the concise rules as she wrote them, along with some of my
thoughts on each one:

"Rule 1: Never do or say anything to make a child feel badly about himself."

This first rule provides a good example of how Jean's words need to be contextualized. For one, she was born in 1926 when it was "normal" to treat children in ways that are now widely considered to be physically or psychologically abusive. For another, Jean's mother was narcissistic and verbally abusive toward her, which perhaps explains why she made this rule #1. But many of today's parents tend to over-apply this rule, trying to prevent their children from ever feeling ANY negative emotions. This ultimately leads them to break the second rule...

"Rule 2: Do not be child-centered."

This one is well documented in TCC and in Jean's article "Who's In Control?" (https://continuumconcept.org/articles/whos-in-control) Over the decades in this forum, I've noticed quite a few CC parents over-applying this rule the way many mainstream parents now over-apply Rule 1. For fear of being child-centered, they err on the side of *ignoring* children. Such errors are an unfortunate side effect of negative rules ("thou shalt not..."), which is why I advise CC parents to internalize a list of *positive* alternatives to what Jean called child-centeredness, with *trust* and *attunement* near the top of the list -- quite the opposite of ignoring.

"Rule 3: Expect children to help you, to serve you."

Here we need to remember Jean's concept of "expectation" as part of our evolutionary continuum, and to distinguish it from the conventional concept of expectations as social "shoulds" upheld through rewards, punishments, and shame. Expecting a child to want to be of service is merely acknowledging their innate sociality. This is why it's so important to let toddlers contribute even when their "help" seems unhelpful, inefficient, or a "waste of time." A little inconvenience in the early years begets huge advantages in the later years as they become more competent AND have grown to see themselves as helpful contributors rather than helpless dependents.

"Rule 4: Do not praise or blame."

Much has been written about this. (See the works of Alfie Kohn, for example.) Again, be careful with negative rules and the tendency to avoid "getting it wrong" rather than cultivating effective, proactive parenting tools.

Regarding praise, it's good to notice if you've been conditioned say "Good job!" all the time, and to come up with responses that are less judgmental and objectifying, but the spirit is more important than the letter of the rule. There's nothing wrong with saying "Good job!" if you are simply expressing your delight and appreciation rather than offering a verbal "dog biscuit" for good behavior. At the same time, Jean pointed out that excessive appreciation of "good" behavior implies that you didn't *expect* it. (See Rule 3.) Thus it is often best simply to reflect the child's own delight in his/her accomlishments, so that praise is replaced by mutual celebration of the child's growing competence.

Regarding "blame" -- judging children's behavior to be "wrong" and then reprimanding them in some way -- I have written about WHY we resort to blame so readily (https://www.dailygroove.com/blame/), but the HOW in this case involves reframing unwanted behavior in terms of a learning process. In other words, it's easier to avoid blame when you understand that children need to make plenty of mistakes as they develop their sociality. It's called trial and error. If you tell yourself that your child is "finding his/her way" and that s/he may have gone "off track" for some reason, you'll see the pointlessness of blaming and punishing, and you'll be free to focus on supporting the learning process.

"Rule 5: Do not do anything for a child that he can do for himself."

This is related to Rule 3 and having positive expectations. Jean pointed out that parental impatience may preclude them giving children enough time to practice doing things for themselves. I would point out that parental perfectionism (an affliction I had to deal with) gets in the way of honoring this rule. One must think long-term and see that it is often better to let children do things unskillfully than to do it for them the "right" way. How else can they develop the skills?

Rule 6: Never say anything more than once.

In other words, don't fall into the role of nagging, which undermines the authoritativeness of your voice and sets you up for future power struggles. I think it's okay to repeat a request if there is cause to believe the child didn't hear or understand the request, but the point is that you don't want your children to think you *need* them to do your bidding. You are giving them a limited-time opportunity to experience the joy of being a team player. If they don't opt in, it's not a problem for you. Trust that they'll eventually realize they want to participate, just like the gardening story of Cesar and Pepe in Chapter One of TCC.

"Rule 7: Do not show fear of a child's displeasure."

This is related to Rules 1 and 2 in that such fears often lead to child-centeredness and/or over-concern about making a child "feel badly about himself." It's also related to the principle of expectations in that such fears carry the implied expectation that children are emotionally fragile and can't handle any upset. I definitely failed to fully honor this rule with my children, in part because my whole family is quite sensitive, and we do in fact need to work harder at developing emotional resilience. Ironically, when we *avoid* emotional upsets we deprive our children and ourselves of opportunities to improve our resilience.

"Rule 8: Do not give choices to a small child."

Yet another easily misunderstood rule. Jean did not mean that you should be controlling. Rather, she meant that if you require your child to make choices about everything, you give the impression that you don't know what to do, and that goes against their innate expectation of having competent caregivers. Much more could be said about this rule, especially with regard to the influences of individualism and consumerism, and how they relate to autonomy and choice. Suffice it to say that every child begins life *in utero* as a "collectivist" -- literally part of a biological collective -- and the development of autonomy, integrated with membership in the family and community, need not be hurried by assuming that young children prefer to choose everything they do.
